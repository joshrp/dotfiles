# Dotfiles

Cooking up the shell on OS X, seasoned for [me][DaMouse404].

If you don't get why then have a read of [some more thoroughly formed thinking][holman-blog]. Then dig through a few examples and start cooking up the right solution for you:

  * [cowboy][cowboy]
  * [gf3][gf3]
  * [holman][holman]
  * [mathiasbynens][mathiasbynens]
  * [matijs][matijs]
  * [robbyrussell][robbyrussell]
  * [rtomayko][rtomayko]
  * [ryanb][ryanb]

## Install

- `git clone git://github.com/DaMouse404/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
- `cd ~/.dotfiles`
- `./dotfiles.sh`

The install task will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory. Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`, though.
